The data set does not have a meta data hence trying to create one for future reference
the following information is given about the data in Kaggle at the following path

This dataset from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance-Jacob France Institute (BNIA-JFI) gathers information about education and youth across Baltimore. Through tracking 27 indicators grouped into seven categories - student enrollment and demographics, dropout rate and high school completion, student attendance, suspensions and expulsions, elementary and middle school student achievement, high school performance, youth labor force participation, and youth civic engagement - BNIA-JFI paints a comprehensive picture of education trends within the city limits. Data sourced from the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS), American Community Survey (ACS), as well as Maryland Department of Education allows for cross program comparison to better map connections between educational outcomes affected by neighborhood context. The 2009-2010 school year was used based on readily available data with an approximated 3.4% of address unable to be matched or geocoded and therefore not included in these calculations. Leveraging this data provides perspective to help guide decisions made at local government level that could impact thousands of lives in years ahead.
